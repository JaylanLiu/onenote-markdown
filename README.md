# onenote-markdown

This is a new prototype for building a markdown editor for OneNote, starting with the editor.

## Why a new project?

The main reason is that the previous attempt wasn't written with full code coverage, and going back to rectify that was painful. There were also some fundamentally bad architectural decisions - like sending multitudes of unnecessary requests to the Microsoft Graph at once.

This attempt starts with building the editor first, instead of the Microsoft Graph interface. The editor is the most complex component, and thus should be a good starting point.

However, starting from scratch doesn't mean that the old project will be completely ignored - bits and pieces will provide "inspiration" when needed.

`/vscode/launch.json`

```Javascript
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "chrome",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Chrome against localhost",
            "url": "http://localhost:3000",
            "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}"
        },

            "type": "chrome",
            "request": "attach",
            "name": "Attach to Chrome against localhost",
            "port": 9222,
            "url": "localhost:3000",
            "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}"
        }
    ]

<path to chrome>/chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

macOS

```shell
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

Linux

```shell
google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222
```
